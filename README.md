My solutions to leetcode.com problems

Each solution is sorted in appropriate notebook according to classification (e.g. problems involving trees, linked lists, backtracking, etc). They are all combined in ascending order (numbering is taken from leetcode.com) in "everything.py" but without problem description.
Some problems that I've recently solved go to "not_yet_classified.ipynb". Eventually I move them to their respective notebooks and add to "everything.py".
